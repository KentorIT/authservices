@model ManageIdpModel
<h1>
    Manage your own IDP
</h1>
<p>
    We have created a unique IDP for you with entityId <a href="@UrlResolver.MetadataUrl">@UrlResolver.MetadataUrl</a>.
    <br />
    Bookmark <a href="@UrlResolver.ManageUrl">@UrlResolver.ManageUrl</a> to be able to manage your IDP in the future.
    <br />
    On your IDP you can set a custom description, a custom ACS and a custom user list. This is done by entering a JSON document below.
    <br />
    The configuration for your IDP must be conforming to the JSON schema <a href="@Url.Content("~/Content/IdpConfigurationSchema.json")">IdpConfigurationSchema.json</a>
    <br />
    First time you visit this page a template document will be displayed.
</p>
<p>
    Your IDP name will not be published. As long is you don't expose your entity id anywhere probably no one will find your IDP.
    <br />
    However there is no further security preventing anyone (including server admins) from reading and modifying your IDP data. Don't expose sensitive data.
    <br />
    By law you are not allowed to store personal information of real persons, especially not civic numbers.
